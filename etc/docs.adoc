= Spring Outbox

Spring Outbox is an implementation of the transactional outbox pattern that helps Spring developers implement an efficient event-driven architecture for microservices and monolithic applications. +
Here is Spring Outbox key considerations:

- When a domain event occurs, it generates one or more messages.
- Each outbox entry represents either an event or a command.
- An operation, part of an event, represents the action performed on the root entity (e.g., create, update, award) and helps consumers determine if deserialization is needed.
- Decouple the outbox message producer and consumer to enable scalability and independent evolution.
- Keep the Debezium connector simple by focusing on reading outbox entries and producing messages.
